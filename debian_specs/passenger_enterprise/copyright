All files located under src/apache2_module hold the same Copyright and license
as the main Passenger source (Copyright (C) 2008-2015 Hongli Lai & Ninh Bui
and GPLv2 only), except where noted below:

A few functions in src/apache2_module/Hooks.cpp are based on the source code of
mod_scgi version 1.9. Its license is included in this file.
Please note that these licensing terms *only* encompass those few
functions, and not Passenger as a whole.

The functions which are based on mod_scgi's code are as follows:
- Hooks::prepareRequest(). Although our version looks nothing like the
  original, the idea of checking for the file's existance from the
  map_to_storage/fixups hook is inspired by mod_scgi's code.
- Hooks::handleRequest(). Although our version looks nothing like the original,
  the idea of passing the backend process's socket file descriptor up to the
  bucket brigade chain is inspired by mod_scgi's code.
- Hooks::http2env(), Hooks::lookupName(), Hooks::lookupHeader(),
  Hooks::lookupEnv(), Hooks::addHeader(): Copied from mod_scgi's functions that
  are named similarly. Slightly modified to make the coding style consistent
  with the rest of Phusion Passenger.
- Hooks::sendHeaders(): Based for the most part on mod_scgi's send_headers()
  function.
